**Mobx**
    observable
    observer
    action.bound
    computed
    reaction, autorun
    inject
    
store
model




instruction :
1. Mobx store
2. @action.bound , @action - use when destructuring if we use this in function, developer tools use(logs), 
    should update the observable in action in strict mode. 
3. can't change style directly by observable variables.
4. computed variables are camelCased.



Points :
1.  to get js array in console us "toJs" module. toJs(array);
2.  to third party component we should convert the mobx array to plain js array by using toJS or splice; <= mobx 4
3. computed, observable variables classes will render
 

MobxModel

yarn vs npm commands 



Reaction :
customReaction = reaction(fun1,fun2)
fun1 - data function
fun2 - reaction function

only the object changes are noticed by the reaction
if u want to trigger when  anything  changes then make the mobx object to palin js object by toJS


Inject :
 provider : childrens gets the data from parent without props.
