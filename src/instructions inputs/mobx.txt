**Mobx**
    observable
    observer
    action.bound
    computed
    reaction, autorun
    inject
    
store
model




Questions :
1. Mobx store
2. @action.bound , @action - use when destructuring if we use this in function, developer tools use(logs), 
    should update the observable in action in strict mode. 
3. can't change style directly by observable variables.
4. computed variables are camelCased.



Points :
1.  to get js array i console us "toJs" module. toJs(array);
2.  to third party component we should convert the mobx array to plain js array by using toJS or splice; <= mobx 4
3. computed, observable variables classes will render
