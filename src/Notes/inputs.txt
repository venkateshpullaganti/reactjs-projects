Covid19 Dashboard common Inputs:

Cleaner Code points :     
        1.object destructure
        2.use children prop in route.
        3. using theme as object.
            const  {selectedTheme : {color}} = this.props;   
        4. See React Instructions on every session
        5. Reduce the state variables.Minimal state variables                               x
        6. Have to use Functional components and Class components operioriately.            
        7. Countries like state variabes should use null at declaration.
        8. Warnings and console errors should be resolved.
        9. UI is priority. Margins,paddings. Details are very important
        10. Only one class component per file.
        11. Loader can abstracted as separate component.
        12. export deafult can be used for the exporting the single component
        13. Error Handling 
                - use appropriate methods accordingly filter-find,
                - filter may return empty array...
                - change in data should not break the code 
                - Component folder structure.
                - should not send the data in state
        14. no inline styles
    
User Perceptive points: 





Doubts:
React router is calling the costrutor twice. calling of function 4 times eventhough i called once explicitly.(filter bar)  -- pending
why spread operator is not assigning to new object.                           -- have to read.
