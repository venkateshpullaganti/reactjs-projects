Instructions to follow while doing Javascript projects:

    All function names and variable names should be in camel case (Ex: firstName)
    All ids should be camel case
    All CSS class names should be hyphenated(Ex: form-input)
    Keep meaningful names (Ex: Don't use a,b,c,ab,bc,x,y,z...etc)
    Do less DOM operations as they impact performance
    CSS classes are generally better for performance than inline styles.
    Use let if the variable changes, Use const if the variable won't change, Don't use var
    Save constants on the top of the javascript file(Ex: Regular expressions)
    An id attribute should be unique and should be given to single element in the entire HTML
